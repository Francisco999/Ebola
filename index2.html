<p>About 200,000 people are having problems getting food because of problems caused by the Ebola outbreak. An analysis by the World Food Program also concluded that if the disease continues to spread at the average rate observed since mid-September, as many as 750,000 people could lose access to affordable food by March 2015. With travel curtailed or blocked in many areas because of the outbreak, the food transport system has been severely disrupted. Liberiaâ€™s borders were closed in August, and cross-border trade has nearly halted.</p>
